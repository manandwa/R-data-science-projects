# Introduction
This project is creating an sqlite database from CSV files.  The CSV files are taken from [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html) which is a site that tracks game statistics for Major League Baseball from the 1800s to today

# Exploring the Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
```

First let's read in the game_log, person_codes, park_codes and team_codes files
```{r}
# To avoid trouble with column types we will set them to a specific type (character, integer, etc.)
game_log <- read_csv("game_log.csv",
                     col_types = cols(.default = "c",
                       v_league = "c", h_league = "c",
                       `3b_umpire_id` = "c", `3b_umpire_name` = "c",
                       `lf_umpire_id` = "c", `lf_umpire_name` = "c",
                       `rf_umpire_id` = "c",  `rf_umpire_name` =  "c",
                       completion = "c", winning_rbi_batter_id = "c",
                       winning_rbi_batter_id_name = "c", "protest" = "c",
                       v_first_catcher_interference = "c",
                     h_first_catcher_interference = "c"))
head(game_log)
```

```{r}
dim(game_log)
```

There are over 170,000 games (171907) which are organized by year from 1871 to 2016

Each game has the following information
* General game information
* Team level statistics
* Umpires that officiated the game
* Awards such as winning/losing pitcher, saving pitcher, Game winning RBI batter

There is no column that shows us that it is a primary key column

```{r}
person_codes <- read_csv("person_codes.csv")
head(person_codes)
```
```{r}
dim(person_codes)
```

This is a list of people with IDs that correspond to the gamelog.  There are debut dates for players, managers, coaches and umpires.  Managers are more like head coaches and coaches are like assistant coaches.  Coaches are not in the game logs.

```{r}
park_codes <- read_csv("park_codes.csv")
head(park_codes)
```
```{r}
dim(park_codes)
```

This is a list of all baseball parks with IDs that match the game log (retrosheet says that this is for column 17 of the game log)

```{r}
team_codes <- read_csv("team_codes.csv")
head(team_codes)
```
```{r}
dim(team_codes)
```

This is a list of all teams with Ids that match the game log

## Defensive positions
The game log has defensive positions for each player listed 1-9 and both [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_positions) and [Baseball Coaching Lab](http://baseballcoachinglab.com/baseball-positions/) list the following:

1. Pitcher
2. Catcher
3. First Baseman
4. Second Baseman
5. Third baseman
6. Shortsop
7. Left Fielder
8. Center Fielder
9. Right Fielder

## Leagues
According to Retrosheet these are the following leagues

* NA: National Association
* NL: National League
* AA: [American Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century))
* UA: [Union Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Association)
* PL: [Players League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Players%27_League)
* AL: American League
* FL: [Federal League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_League)

# Importing Data into SQLite
We will now import our dataframes into sql tables and in the game_log table include a game_id that is the date home team and the number of game.  This game_id is based on the id entry from [here](https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm)

```{r}
conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "mlb.db")

# Create the game_log table
dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "game_log",
             value = game_log, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

# Create the person_codes table
dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "person_codes",
             value = person_codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

# Create the team_codes table
dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "team_codes",
             value = team_codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

# Create park_codes table
dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "park_codes",
             value = park_codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

# List all the tables
dbListTables(conn)
```

```{r}
# add the game_id column in game_log
add_game_id_command <- "
  ALTER TABLE game_log
  ADD COLUMN game_id TEXT
"

dbExecute(conn, add_game_id_command)

# Update this column based on Retrosheet specifications
update_game_id_command <-"
UPDATE game_log
SET game_id = date || h_name || number_of_game
/*WHERE stops this if it is already done*/
WHERE game_id IS NULL;
"

dbExecute(conn, update_game_id_command)
```
```{r}
# Verifying queries to confirm
check_game_id_query <- "
SELECT
  game_id,
  date,
  h_name,
  number_of_game
FROM game_log
LIMIT 5;
"
check_query <- dbGetQuery(conn, check_game_id_query)
head(check_query)
```

Checking in DBeaver also verifies that this column is there

# Looking for Normalization Opportunities
We can normalize our data in the following ways

* All debut dates from person_codes can be obtained from the game_log
* The start, end and sequence columns in team_codes can be obtained from the game_log
* The start and end years in park_codes can be obtained from the game_log
* We have a player_id followed by a player name in game_log we can remove those columns and use person_codes
* We have offensive and defensive statistics repeated in game_log for both the home and visiting teams.  We can remove these columns and put this in its own table
* We can remove the listing for 9 players on each team and place them in their own table that tracks player appearances and positions
* We can also remove the umpires from game_log and either place them in their own table or make a combined table with players, umpires, and managers
* We also have a few columns for awards which we can put in a separate table or combine them with generl appearances of players

# Planning a normalized schema
This is the schema that we are using here base on normalization created in DBDesigner.net
![Database Schema](dataquest_schema.PNG)

# Creating Tables Without Foreign Keys
Here we will create four tables based on our new schema:

* person
* park
* league
* appearance_type
